This project is for my PhD research, where I try to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of behavioral manipulation in ants that are infected with the fungus Ophiocordyceps. We use GoPro’s to film the ants to analyze the behavior of ants, however, we had a lot of problems such as camera’s falling into the box, changing views, low resolution during dark phase and infrared lights that stopped working. Therefore, we wanted to standardize the way the ants were filmed making it possible to use computer software to measure the behavior.


## Main features

To overcome the above mentioned problems, a new set up was designed containing 2 components, an infrared ringlight and a mount that can be attached to the box. The advantage of the latter is that it allows you to move the box without changing the view. The mount exists of 2 3D printed clamps that can be tightened to the box with screws and nuts, and Plexiglas that has been laser cut and bended with heat afterwards. The infrared light was 3D printed, onto which an infrared LED strip was glued and soldered. To enable a computer to do the laborious task of counting ants, changes had to be made to the previous ‘nest tube’ and ‘feeding tubes’ as well, since these tubes were able roll around. Therefore, a feeding station that can hold the feeding tubes in place and a nest that can easily be inspected were 3D printed. The idea is that the bottom of these designs will be put in the box before the plaster is poured, which is used for humidity and to avoid flares in videos, so that these objects won’t be able to move. 



+ Build: Contains all the (binary) design files that are needed for the hardware. Use subfolder for more complex assemblies.
+ Docs: Contains the documentation of the project: background information, sources, warnings, and build instructions. 
+ Results: For measurement or functional devices, it is good to report some results as a benchmark for others who try to replicate the project.
+ Software: For hardware projects that have an operating software or firmware, it is a good versioning practice to separate the software code from build instructions.

## Build instructions
_Guide the reader with the order of browsing your project repository for an optimum building experience_
 
When you want to start a new repository, it is better that you copy this repository to your project repository and start by changing all the description.
All instructions and (sub)headers are suggestions. You can change the style, order, or composition as you see necessary. 

It would be kind if you put a shortcut to your Bill of Materials file.
This template can be copied free of charge. 

## Outcomes
_Here you can list the outcomes of the project that you would like to hightlight. It does not need to be an exhaustive list_

We will list some best practices and good examples from projects that have used this template for their documentation.

## Team
_Even though platforms such as github show a list of user accounts for contributors for a project or repository, the past contributors or external collaborators also deserve a place here_
