This project is for my PhD research, where I try to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of behavioral manipulation in ants that are infected with the fungus Ophiocordyceps. We use GoPro’s to analyze the behavior of ants, however, we had a lot of problems such as camera’s falling into the box, changing views, low resolution during dark phase and infrared lights that stopped working. Therefore, we wanted to standardize the way the ants were filmed making it possible to use computer software to measure the behavior.


## Main features

To overcome the above mentioned problems, a new set up was designed containing 2 components, an infrared ringlight and a mount that can be attached to the box. The advantage of the latter is that it allows you to move the box without changing the view. The mount exists of 2 3D printed clamps that can be tightened to the box with screws and nuts, and Plexiglas that has been laser cut and bended with heat afterwards. The infrared light was 3D printed as well, onto which an infrared LED strip was glued and soldered. To enable a computer to do the laborious task of counting ants, changes had to be made to the previous ‘nest tube’ and ‘feeding tubes’, since these tubes were able roll around. Therefore, a feeding station that can hold the feeding tubes in place and a nest that can easily be inspected were 3D printed. The idea is that the bottom of these designs will be put in the box before the plaster is poured, which is used for humidity and to avoid flares in videos, so that these objects won’t be able to move. 



+ Build: Contains all the design files that are needed for the hardware (e.g. step and dxf files) 
+ Docs: Contains the documentation of the project: background information, sources, warnings, and build instructions. 
+ Results: For measurement or functional devices, it is good to report some results as a benchmark for others who try to replicate the project.
+ Software: For hardware projects that have an operating software or firmware, it is a good versioning practice to separate the software code from build instructions.
