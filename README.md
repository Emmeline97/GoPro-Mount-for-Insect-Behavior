This project is for my PhD research, where I try to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of behavioral manipulation in ants that are infected with the fungus Ophiocordyceps. We use GoPro’s to analyze the behavior of ants, however, we had a lot of problems such as camera’s falling into the box, changing views, low resolution during dark phase and infrared lights that stopped working. Therefore, we wanted to standardize the way the ants were filmed making it possible to use computer software to measure the behavior.


## Main features

To overcome the above mentioned problems, a new set up was designed containing 2 components, an infrared ringlight and a mount that can be attached to the box. The advantage of the latter is that it allows you to move the box without changing the view. The mount exists of 2 3D printed clamps that can be tightened to the box with screws and nuts, and Plexiglas that has been laser cut and bended with heat afterwards. The infrared light was 3D printed as well, onto which an infrared LED strip was glued and soldered. To enable a computer to do the laborious task of counting ants, changes had to be made to the previous ‘nest tube’ and ‘feeding tubes’, since these tubes were able roll around. Therefore, a feeding station that can hold the feeding tubes in place and a nest that can easily be inspected were 3D printed. The idea is that the bottom of these designs will be put in the box before the plaster is poured, which is used for humidity and to avoid flares in videos, so that these objects won’t be able to move.

## Materials & Methods

GoPro Hero 6 cameras were modified to detect infrared light to film ants during the dark phase. The lenses were replaced by one without an infrared filter, either a GoPro Hero 7 DIY Full-Spectrum Conversion Lens (available from https://kolarivision.com/product/gopro-7-diy-full-spectrum-conversion-lens/?srsltid=AfmBOop-7VIMicQSSRpHtIMeaenSbQpz0pA3qMEJWtjVQvey48yzJiMJ) later referred to as GoPro Low or a GoPro Lens without infrared filter from an unknown company later referred to as GoPro High. The box used for the set-up is 10L 15cmx32.5cmx26.5cm from Araven (available from https://www.makro.nl/marketplace/product/d647a773-c7fc-4144-bd8c-63ca70879da8?mfeed_oid=2f0b9088-aa00-4891-a1e4-1f92d8e6aa14&mfeed_bm=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=nl_mm_ag_pmax_all_dynamic_all_b2c_feed_low&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6Ou5BhCrARIsAPoTxrAcVcLwS7MtLeJDwj0bKCbDfylk79pxsYUytf5q21WvwWKLhJZ5SGUaAjlqEALw_wcB&itm_pm=cookie_consent_accept_button). The mount used to secure the GoPro at an appropriate height above the box comprises two components; Plexiglass and 3D printed clamps. Plexiglass was laser cut from an DXF file and subsequently bended at two places using 2 heated wires at 80˚C. Clamps were 3D printed on a FMD 3D printer with PETG filaments. They can be tightened to the box with flat knurled head thumb screws of stainless steel M3x10mm and M3 nuts. Next, a ring light was produced using the same 3D-printing technique as described above, to which an infrared LED strip, cut in 4 pieces, was glued with cyanoacrylate. The infrared LED strip contains 60 LEDs per meter, has a wattage of 14.4W per meter and a voltage of 12V (available from https://ledlightsworld.com/products/dc12v-smd5050-300-ir-infrared-850nm-940nm-tri-chip-flexible-led-strips-60leds-14-4w-per-meter?variant=17838007943258). The pieces of the LED strip were soldered together with 24AWG wires to a DC connector and hot glue were added to make it humidity proof. The clamps and the infrared ring light are designed to slide into one another. Lastly, the nest box (ant house) and the feeding station were printed on a 3D printer with ABS filaments, except for the inside of the ant house which was printed on a 3D printer with ASA filaments. Both the ant house as the feeding station were designed in such a way that when placing them in the box before pouring plaster, the bottoms of the designs are secured but the top of designs can still be removed for easy inspection during the experiment.
