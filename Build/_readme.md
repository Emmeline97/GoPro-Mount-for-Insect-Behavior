# Documentation Build Folder

In this folder you can find the step files for the 3D designs and the dxf files for lasercutting Plexiglass. We had to make two mounts since our lab has access to multiple GoPro Hero 6 camera's with 2 different lenses. The one that has to be placed higher above the box is called 'high' and the other 'low'. The 'high' mount is designed for a GoPro with a GoPro Hero 7 DIY Full-Spectrum Conversion Lens from Kolarivision.com.
